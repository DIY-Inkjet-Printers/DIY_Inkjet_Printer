### Prepare Prints

When SLA printing the back plate of the assembly, the  
liquid connection terminals may not be perfectly circular. 

<br>

Use a file and or sandpaper to carefully shape them up.

/>

<br>
<br>

### Insert Actuators

Insert the piezo actuator discs into the chambers and  
route their wires through either the left or right opening.

<br>

Next layer the cut-to-shape O-rings on top of the actuator,  
with the gap pointing towards the direction of the wires.

### Combine Plates

Align the front and back plate on top of each other.

<br>

Place the nuts in the indentations of the front plate.

<br>

/>

<br>

Insert the screws from the back and lightly fasten them  
to the point where the screw - nut pairs stay together.

<br>

Flip the assembly on it's head and tighten the screws.

<br>

<br>

> **Warning** Don't over tighten your screws,  
this could damage and break your plates.
