</div>

Assembling the Piezo Pumps
The heart of the machine are the four piezo pumps which are made of the following parts:

- piezo pump body

- piezo pump cover / mounting bracket

- 8x M3x20 screws

- 8x M3 nuts

- 2x O - ring 21x25x2mm

- 2x 27mm piezo disc

- 2x check valve

- petrol filter

- 6mm silicone tubing

<br>

### Combining Plates

Align the front and back plate on top of each other.

Place the nuts in the indentations of the front plate.

Insert the screws from the back and lightly fasten them  
to the point where the screw - nut pairs stay together.

First, insert the screws from the bottom through the pump body and place the piezo discs with the O - ring in the pump chambers (cut out a piece of the o - ring for the solder connection on the piezo).

Put the pump cover on top of it...

and put the nuts onto the scews. Then carefully lift the parts  and tighten the screws from the bottom.

Next you need to put the tubes and check valves onto the connections. For that it could be necessary remove ridges at the connection by filing, to get a sealed connection.

After that you can add the check valves to the pump...

and connect the ink container and printhead to the pump.

For keeping the ink clean add the petrol filter to the tube in the ink container.

Mount the pump with two M5 screws and nuts to your machine and you have finished the assembly of the pump.
